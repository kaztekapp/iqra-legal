    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective Date: February 16, 2026</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>KazTek LLC ("we", "us", or "our") operates the IQra2.0 mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our App.</p>
      <p>By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
      <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email address and display name through our authentication provider (Supabase).</p>
      <p>We do not collect any other personal information beyond what is needed for account creation and authentication.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>
      <p>The following data is stored only on your device and is never transmitted to our servers:</p>
      <p>- Learning progress (letters learned, vocabulary mastered, lessons completed)<br>
      - App preferences (language, vowel mark settings)<br>
      - Downloaded audio files for offline use<br>
      - Voice recordings made during pronunciation practice (processed on-device only and never uploaded)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>
      <p>- <strong>Supabase:</strong> For user authentication and account management.<br>
      - <strong>Quran.com API:</strong> To fetch Quran text and translations. No personal data is sent.<br>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Microphone and Speech Recognition</h2>
      <p>The App offers optional pronunciation practice features that use your device's microphone and speech recognition capabilities.</p>
      <p>Voice data is processed entirely on your device using the operating system's built-in speech recognition. We do not record, store, or transmit any voice data to our servers.</p>
      <p>You can use the App without granting microphone permissions. Pronunciation practice is entirely optional.</p>
    </div>

      - Enable you to sync your learning progress across devices (future feature)<br>
      - Send important service-related notifications</p>
      <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We do not display advertisements in the App.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information. Account data is secured through Supabase's enterprise-grade security infrastructure, including encryption at rest and in transit.</p>
      <p>However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
    </div>
